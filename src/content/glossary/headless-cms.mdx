First of all, let's have a look at what the cryptic letters CMS is short for:
- **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystem.

Now, let's have a look at the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless) definition of **headless** when it comes to computing and software:

- A server with no monitor, keyboard or mouse attached.
- Software capable of working on a device without a graphical user interface.
- A browser without a graphical user interface.
- A [backend](/glossary/backend)-only Content Management System that employs APIs to display content.

By combining these two definitions, it's becoming clearer what a headless CMS actually is.

## The longer explanation
For this explanation we'll be using WordPress as the definition of a traditional CMS. It's widely used and a CMS that most web developers have some kind of experience with or knowledge of.

Most commonly still, [WordPress](/glossary/wordpress) provides a graphical user interface for both managing the content **and** displaying it to the visitors of a website.

When you install WordPress and start using it, you'll have everything you need for presenting your beautiful website to your visitors:
- A graphical user interface for **managing** your content.
- A graphical user interface for **serving** your content to your visitors.

In contrast, if you installed a headless CMS like [Strapi](/glossary/strapi), you'd only have the first part: A graphical user interface for **managing** your content. How you actually serve it to your visitors is totally up to you.

Typically, a [frontend](/glossary/frontend) developer would create a website using [Next.js](/glossary/nextjs), [Gatsby](/glossary/gatsby), [Astro](/glossary/astro) or one of the many other options available for consuming the Strapi [API](/glossary/api) and serving the content to your visitors.
